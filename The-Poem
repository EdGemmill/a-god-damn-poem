I had a little nut tree
and nothing would it grow
So I dug it up and burned it
and bought an apple tree instead.

I do not own that poem
credit and all rights to Colin McNaughton I think

now I'll actually do a thing

The rhyme scheme will be abcc
I'm not used to writing poems
But I may as well set down some rules right now
Don't want to end end up confused with the why, when or how

I just had a pleasent talk with my GP
We discussed my medication
I probably shouldn't be writing with beer
But it shushes the critical voice in my ear

I struggle to write without straight up copying better wordsmiths
I've always been a better critic than creator
I need to hurry up with my videos already
Theres vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti.
