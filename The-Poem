I had a little nut tree
and nothing would it grow
So I dug it up and burned it
and bought an apple tree instead.

I do not own that poem
credit and all rights to Colin McNaughton I think

now I'll actually do a thing

The rhyme scheme will be abcc
I'm not used to writing poems
But I may as well set dpwn the rules rigt now
DOn'r eant to end end uop confused with tyhe why when or how

I just hasd a pleasent tal with my GP
We disc=cussed my medication
Probably shouldn't be writing with beer
But it shushes the critical voice in my ear

I struggle to write without straight up copying better wordsmiths
I've always been a better critic than creator
I need to hurry up with my videos already
theres vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti.
